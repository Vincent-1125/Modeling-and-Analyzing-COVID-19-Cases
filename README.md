# Modeling-and-Analyzing-COVID-19-Cases
we investigated a dataset that contains information about COVID-19 cases in the United States, vaccination rates, and various other metadata that can assist in modeling various aspects of COVID-19.

Key techniques include:
* Bootstrap sampling
* Bias-variance tradeoff and decomposition
* Multicollinearity in features
